# README - Using PHP Forms
The purpose of this folder is to go through how PHP can be used to sent forms across different pages. This will look at creating a form, which will allow for the user to enter in a message, this message will be sent to another file to be displayed onto the screen.

## Form Actions
Form actions are used to re-directed the user to another file, once the form is submitted i.e. when a button is pressed.

## POST vs. GET
There are two types of form methods:
- GET; This will send the data through the URL (good for testing or for when you want users to be able to "bookmark" a specific query)
- POST; This will send the data behind the scenes (good for when you want secure data to be sent such as passwords)

Whichever method is used, they will both get the data using the name of the input that it was provided
